# Parallel Computing with GPUs

This repository contains my solutions to CUDA laboratories of the course [Parallel Computing with GPUs](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/teaching/COM4521/).

The provided solutions contain up-to-date replacements (as of June 2023) to deprecated primitives and functionalities referred to in the labs descriptions, e.g. we use the Nsight profiling tool [Nsight Compute Cli](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightComputeCli/index.html) instead of the deprecated [CUDA Occupancy Calculator](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-occupancy-calculator/). Notice we use the light-weight (not-interactive) Nsight Compute Cli and not [Nsight Compute](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightCompute/index.html).
